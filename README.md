# Kruskal-s-Algorithm---DAA-Greedy-Approach
Engineering college assignments never dies right??? So here's one! We were taught Kruskal's Algorithm as a part of DAA. And here's my hand's on approach to it. 
TBH I hate minimum spanning trees. Sorry DAA Faculty.

Kruskal's algorithm is the concept that is introduced in the graph theory of discrete mathematics. It is used to discover the shortest path between two points in a connected weighted graph. This algorithm converts a given graph into the forest, considering each node as a separate tree.
